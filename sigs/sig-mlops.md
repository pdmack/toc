# CDF MLOps SIG

## Overview
The MLOps SIG creates designs, specifications, shared code and processes to enable MLOps and Data and ML Pipeline capabilities on top of CD Projects, e.g. Tekton. 

## Agenda

* Define requirements for MLOps for Tekton
* Investigate potential existing dominant technologies in ML Pipeliens space, and their integration with Tekton e.g. Kubeflow Pipelines
* Plan for quarterly face-to-face meetings

The SIG will deliver designs, specifications, shared code and processes that meet the following goals:

* Enable actions performed while writing code, compiling, testing, and distributing software to be manifested and verifiable.
* Enable integration between MLOps Pipelines and Tekton e.g. Kubeflow Pipelines working with Tekton as a backend
* Enable support structure for this code to be maintained, tested on a rigorous level
* Define architecture and guidelines around Lineage tracking, Metadata collection, Experiment tracking, Date versioning, ETL operations etc. which a typical Data and ML Pipeline shall support
